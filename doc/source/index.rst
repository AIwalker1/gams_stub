A new GAMS project 
==================

This is the 'landing page' with a general description of your project. 
You can easily add new subpages and format the content using reStructuredText (rst).  

The page documentation_ is built automatically from the comments in the GAMS file 'main.gms'
whenever your run 'make html'. If you add more '.gms' files, comments will be automatically converted into '.rst'
input files, but you will need to manually include references to the resulting html files either on a page or 
the Table of Contents. See the link to the documentation_ and the `Table of Contents`_ below as an example.  

.. _documentation: model/main.html
